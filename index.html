        I have created this webpage to experiment how Javascripts can be used to
        show modals or hide modals. And I believe, I succeeded. This was a great
        way to know Javascript even more. Now I think I can do bigger tasks
        using Javascript. I mean it is fun to work with this language. But, this
        is just the beginning. There are so many things left to explore. Slowly
        and slowly, I will try to gain knowledge from those parts according to
        my capacity. I believe I will not disappoint myself. After all, I am a
        person with strong thinking sense.
